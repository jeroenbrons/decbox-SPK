 Installing SORT/MERGE package

*********************************************************
**     This is the beginning of the dialogue to        **
**  define the attributes of your SORT/MERGE utility.  **
*********************************************************
 
This procedure will, by default, build and install
SORT and MERGE for optimum performance.  The utility
SORT and MERGE tasks will have the following attributes:
 
    SORT  built at 32K WORDS / MERGE built at 32K WORDS
    Have ASCII as the default character collating sequence
    Process duplicate records
    Do a non-stable SORT and MERGE
    Retry 2000 times when trying to read a locked bucket
    Allow 55% of the SORT work area for SORT tree structure
    Allow 30% of the MERGE work area for MERGE data structure
    Use five (5) work files for SORT
    Use the RECORD sort process
    Sequence check the input files for MERGE
 
Additionally, the default installation will NOT build the
SORT and MERGE callable subroutines as a resident library.
 
If you want the installation to proceed using
these defaults, answer YES.  If you want to
change any of these defaults, answer NO.
 
Do you want to proceed with the default installation             <YES>? 
 
************************************************
** Your SORT AND MERGE  product will be built **
** according to the following specifications: **
************************************************
 
SORT  TASK SIZE IS 32K WORDS
MERGE TASK SIZE IS 32K WORDS
YOU HAVE THE FOLLOWING RUNTIME DEFAULTS:
    ASCII CHARACTER COLLATING SEQUENCE
    RECORDS WITH DUPLICATE KEYS PROCESSED
    NO STABLE PROCESS
    2000 LOCKED BUCKET RETRIES
    55% OF WORK AREA FOR SORT DATA STRUCTURES
    45% OF WORK AREA FOR SORT RMS DATA STRUCTURES
    30% OF WORK AREA FOR MERGE DATA STRUCTURES
    70% OF WORK AREA FOR MERGE RMS DATA STRUCTURES
    05 WORK FILES
    RECORD SORT
    SEQUENCE CHECK MERGE INPUT
NO RESIDENT LIBRARY WILL BE BUILT
 
ARE THE ABOVE DEFAULTS THE DESIRED ONES    <YES or NO>           <YES>? 
 
*****************************************************
**  This is the end of the installation dialogue.  **
**    The installation will now proceed without    **
**         further operator intervention.          **
*****************************************************
