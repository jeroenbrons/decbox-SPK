In order to compile COBOL programs you must run the
compiler with r cbl74 or r cobol (if you want cobol68)
at the * prompt type the following to compile the example program

test,test.lis=test.cbl

after you hit return it should do some compiling and
give you back to the * prompt

hit ^Z to exit and then type r link
then type
test
test/ssave
/go

this will produce an executable file. you can modify this procedure to make
your own cobol programs using the format of test.cbl as a guide along with the
DEC COBOL manuals which are admittedly rather terse.
